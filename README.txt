My first attempt at a minesweeper game.

Currently only a 5x5 grid with 5 mines, but will be extending it to user choice.

Left click to reveal a space, right click to mark it with a flag (blue square).

Need to add in a function to make sure the first click does not end in a loss.

Need to add better images for flags/mines
